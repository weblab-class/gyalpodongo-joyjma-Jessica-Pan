# I feel ____ is now a website!!! 

## Current functionality 

I feel text box that accepts inputs, and submits when you press the enter key. It just puts those at the bottom of the screen.

## Next Steps

-Creating an avatar using feelings
-Have example emotions scroll
-Implement the main webpage 
  -view your tags
  -tag others 

## What we provide

- Google Auth (Skeleton.js & auth.js)
  - Disclaimer: Auth isn't being taught until the second week.
- Socket Infrastructure (client-socket.js & server-socket.js)
  - Disclaimer: Socket isn't being taught until the second week.
- User Model (auth.js & user.js)


## Socket stuff
Note: we'll be getting to this in lecture in week 2, so don't worry if you don't know it yet

- If you're not using realtime updating or don't need server->client communication, you can remove socket entirely! (server-socket.js, client-socket.js, and anything that imports them)
- If you are using socket, consider what you want to do with the FIXME in server-socket.js
